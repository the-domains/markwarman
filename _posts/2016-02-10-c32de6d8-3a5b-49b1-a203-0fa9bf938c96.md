When I meet someone and the inevitable 'so what do you do?' question comes up, I'll respond that I'm a digital consultant. Depending on the crowd, the next question is often, 'Great! Can you fix my computer?' but, once I've explained myself a little more, I often get asked 'what's next?'.

This is a question I love. When $40,000 can [help people who have been paralysed stand again][0] or biodegradable blobs can [replace plastic water bottles][1], when [Amazon Prime Air][2] aims to deliver orders within 30 minutes and the [Grid][3] can automatically design a website around the content you populate it with - my answer is 'anything'.
